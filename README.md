# FlyAlytics

The code for a Real-Time Analytics dashboard powered by flybase.io.

Edit `flyaltics.js` and `dashboard/js/dashboard.js` with your flybase account info.

This will push real-time events to your dashboard so you can see visitors on your site as they move around.

If you want to store user data for historical purposes, then you can also set data to `push` to your flybase account.

Currently, this is entirely real-time event driven, so no data is stored.
